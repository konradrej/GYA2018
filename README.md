GYA2018, a fairly simple one page game of battleships. Created as my "gymnasiearbete" which is a year long project during the last year of high school in Sweden. Written in HTML, CSS (Sass) and JS (including jQuery) might incorperate a bit of php and either a text file or a mysql database to make a game history.

## Getting started
### Prerequisities
#### Sass
1. Goto dart-sass github release page [(Link)](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/)
2. Download latest release matching your operating system
3. Goto this page explaining how to add files to system path and follow the instructions [(Link)](https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/)

##### Usage
On windows either use the compile.bat to generate a main.css files based off main.scss or the method for the other platforms.

On other platforms use this code in a commandline terminal located in the same folder as main.scss

```
sass main.scss main.css
```
